# Eidos
Eidos is a tiny and principled library for modelling IDs.
It does one thing and does it well, allowing you to build tagged IDs
with _Ã  la carte_ pretty-printing and validation, and an emphasis on
type safety and correct-by-construction code.  We can do better than
`String`.

```scala
import eidos._

case object QnD
type QnD = QnD.type

case object Customer extends MakeLabel with UUID
type Customer = Customer.type

case object Device extends CustomLabel with Regex {
 def pattern = "(abc)+12"
 def label = "Phone"
}
type Device = Device.type

// and then

scala > Id.of[QnD]("no validation required!")
res1: Id[QnD] = Id(no validation required!)

scala> Id.of[Customer]("e07fa50f-7ddf-4e7c-acf5-420406e5a7c5")
res2: Option[Id[Customer]] = Some(CustomerId(e07fa50f-7ddf-4e7c-acf5-420406e5a7c5))

scala> Id.of[Customer]("not-a-uuid")
res3: Option[Id[Customer]] = None

scala> Id.of[Device]("abcabc12")
res4: Option[Id[Device]] = Some(PhoneId(abcabc12))
```
## Getting Eidos
The first release is coming soon. You can clone the repository to
experiment with the library in the meantime.
